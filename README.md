Ok, I got it now. On the font asset creator I increased the padding from 5 to 10, the atlas resolution from 512x512 to 4096x4096 and changed the rendering mode from hinted smooth to raster hinted. The text looks great on all resolutions, unless I resize the window while the game is running, but I guess that's the way it is. I may have exaggerated on the numbers (like 4096x4096 resolution), but at least I know it works, I can try lower numbers later.
